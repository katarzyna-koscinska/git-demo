Well, she moves like lightning 
and she counts to three
Then she turns out all the lights
And says she's coming for me
Now put your hands up, this is a heist
And there's no one in here living
Gonna make it out alive
She said, green, green grass, blue, blue sky
You better throw a party on the day that I die
Green, green grass, blue, blue sky
You better throw a party on the day that I die
