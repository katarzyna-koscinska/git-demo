Well, she moves like lightning 
and she counts to three
Then she turns out all the lights
And says she's coming for me
Now put your hands up, this is a heist
And there's no one in here living
Gonna make it out alive
Loaded up when the sun comes down
Getaway car for two young lovers
Me and the girl straight out of town
Over the hills and undercover, undercover, undercover
